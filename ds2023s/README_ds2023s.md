HI!

You can check the note for this course in 'python笔记'.

Forgive me for writing all the notes in English, but I hope it would not cause many troubles in understanding. 

Plus, it is highly RECOMMENDED to download the notes and read them locally using some handy markdown editors, since the MENU might help a lot for figuring out the structure.

`Lecture Note` part is mostly based on Q's lecturing.

`Supplements` part is according to some additional information or materials I have found.

Moreover, I am pretty sure that there will be a lot of typos or gramatical mistakes, etc. lol

The *DISCUSSIONS* part in this github rep is available, so just feel free to chat & discuss & report any possible mistakes !

Hope you find it helpful~
